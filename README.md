# rock-paper-scissors
rock paper scissors game project

This is the pseudocode algorithm for the game, it is not complete but i was able to code the rest without the algorithm.
Functions:
getComputerChoice
getHumanChoice
humanScore
computerScore
playRound
playGame

pseudocode:
WRITE logic for computer choice
 CREATE function getComputerChoice
  WRITE code to return one value of rock,paper or scissors
  USE Math.random method to return a random number between 1-3
   IF random number is = 1 return rock,
   IF random number is = 2 return paper,
   IF random number is = 3 return scissors
   ENDCONDITION
DISPLAY OUTPUT
WRITE logic for human choice
 CREATE function getHumanChoice
  WRITE code to return one value of rock,paper or scissors
  PROMPT user for a string rock paper or scissors
  STORE the string to a variable 
  IF prompted string is ROCK PAPER or SCISSORS return value
  ELSE display invalid choice
  ENDCONDITION
DISPLAY OUTPUT
WRITE logic to play a single round
 CREATE function playRound
 
I mostly used functions because it was the step that needed to be followed in the course, there was also some hints that made me able to solve some of the problem.
I know the pseudocode is a bit messy for now so im planning to improve how i write it.
